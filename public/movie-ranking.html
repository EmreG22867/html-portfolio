<h1>The Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Star Wars - Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>It may sound clichée but this is the climax of a sixtology about Darth Vader, so duhh</p>
<h3>WALL•E</h3>
<p>I watched it in cinema when I was 6 or so, and I love animation.</p>
<h3>Patch Addams</h3>
<p>A beautiful movie starring Robin Williams, with a lot of different layers and plots, a true slice of life movie.</p>
<h3>honorable mention: The wind rises</h3>
<p>A beautiful and bittersweet anime movie by Hayao Miazaki, although I don't like the fact that it kind of glorifies the invention of war machines</p>
